## Web Developer

As a Web Developer, my mission is to make your dreams come true. I will put all my energy to create websites that looks like you or your company.
I will always do my best to be pixel perfect while respecting responsive design and W3C recommandations.
Last but not least, I will keep myself up to date about best practices and new technologies to ensure you the best quality work.

## Services

    ### Web Development

    My goal is to provide you the website you want and the website you need. From the landing page to the e-commerce shop, they all have the purpose of creating interactivity with users. I'll be using HTML, CSS and Javascript(ES6).

    ### Web Applications

    They never have been more important, to realise them I will use React and/or Next.js. I will provide a clean and readable code while being reusable and scalable.

    ### Responsive design

    Mobile first is my first principle, I also make sure of the accessibility of your websites.
